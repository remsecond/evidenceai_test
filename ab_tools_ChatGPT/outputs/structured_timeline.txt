Ok. Noting you want to spend the time in mediation to discuss the interpretation.

Thanks!
I am happy to share this with the Lisa (s) and follow whatever interpretation we arrive at.
I certainly don't want us to argue over it. I am more than happy to go along with the plan.

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.
Confirming if you want to address in mediation next week, and I will make a note to Natalie.
