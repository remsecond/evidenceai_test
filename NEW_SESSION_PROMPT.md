## Session Start Instructions

1. Check environment:
```powershell
python src/test_pipeline.py
```

2. Review last checkpoint:
```powershell
python src/report_checkpoints.py
```

3. Choose next step:
- Continue from last checkpoint
- Start fresh with new component
- Run tests on existing components

## Development Guidelines
1. Work on one track at a time
2. Verify checkpoints after each major change
3. Run tests before ending session
4. Document any new requirements or insights

## Questions for Session Start
1. Which stage needs attention next?
2. Are there any validation issues to address?
3. What improvements are needed in current stage?
4. What is the priority for next development phase?
