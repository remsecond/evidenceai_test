### EvidenceAI: Workflow Analysis and Development

**Project Overview:**
EvidenceAI automates document workflows like Our Family Wizard PDFs. We are implementing threading, relationship analysis, and topic detection modules.

**Current Focus:**
The workflow script will identify the last completed stage. If continuing, the next stage will likely involve threading logic to group parsed messages into structured threads.

**Immediate Task:**
1. Validate parsed message data.
2. Implement threading logic to organize messages by parent-child relationships.
3. Prepare threaded outputs for the next stage: relationship analysis.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the script to determine progress.
- Confirm continuation from the last checkpoint or start fresh.
