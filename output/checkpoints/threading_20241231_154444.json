Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.\n<EndChatGPT/>\n-----------------------------------------------------\nSo..... ... I\u2019ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn\u2019t about me - it\u2019s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he\u2019s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It\u2019s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as\nthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.",

I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over.\nHe will reach Max\u2019s age and it will come and go.

No child ever benefits from his parents fighting. Ever.\nBefore this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian\u2019s agency till 18.\nSomething that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that\u2019s fine. He doesn\u2019t.\nBut taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are\nabout that. I\u2019ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.\nIt was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were\n\u201creal kids.\u201d\nThis is 100x that. They are blood brothers. And this is their parents. Talk about really doubting your identity.

I\u2019ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn\u2019t about me - it\u2019s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he\u2019s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It\u2019s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as\nthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.",

You did that this summer as well\nwhen he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.\nFor the record:\n1. Factual Comparison of Children's Status:\nMax (16):\n- Full autonomy over relationship\n- Direct communication with both parents\n- Ability to modify contact based on preferences\n- No supervision requirements\n- No phase requirements\n- Immediate implementation of his choices\nAdrian (12):\n- No autonomy until age 18\n- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference\n- Must follow rigid phase system\n- Maximum contact permanently reduced\n- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance\n- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice\n2. Documented Impact:\n2023: 66 days of direct father-son time\nCurrent Framework:\n- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly\n- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level\n- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance\n- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time\n3. Mediation Record:\n- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max\n Page 84 of 358\n- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality\n- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18\n- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood\n4. Professional Documentation:\n- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.\n- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023\n- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation\n- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule\nYou did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give\nAdrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence\nhim, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive \"no.\" Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice\nfrom now till adulthood,\nI came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18\nmonths and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 07:54 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo: Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 09:13 AM)\nSubject: Re: What Happened Today\nAdrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice.

Documented Impact:\n2023: 66 days of direct father-son time\nCurrent Framework:\n- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly\n- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level\n- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance\n- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time\n3. Mediation Record:\n- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max\n- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality\n Page 90 of 358\n- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18\n- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood\n4. Professional Documentation:\n- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.\n- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023\n- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation\n- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule\nYou did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give\nAdrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence\nhim, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive \"no.\" Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice\nfrom now till adulthood,\nI came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18\nmonths and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 07:54 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo: Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 09:13 AM)\nSubject: Re: What Happened Today\nAdrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice.

Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then\nnothing he says will matter. You took that.\nAnd you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me\u2019s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how\nclose you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my\nproposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation.

Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.\n<EndChatGPT/>\n-----------------------------------------------------\nSo..... ... I\u2019ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn\u2019t about me - it\u2019s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he\u2019s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It\u2019s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as\nthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.",
