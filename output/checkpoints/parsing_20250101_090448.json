(Mature man/stable job)\nVacate?\n99% of listings for sale, are offering to pay the buyers commission 2.5% to 3%.\nBuyers' agent - need to have buyers' agreement - this could include buyer pays them 3%.\nBuyers agent may insist on difference and could be negotiating point for seller to pay the difference, or buyer will pay.",

You did that this summer as well when he\ntold two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.\nFor the record:\n1. Factual Comparison of Children's Status:\nMax (16):\n- Full autonomy over relationship\n- Direct communication with both parents\n- Ability to modify contact based on preferences\n- No supervision requirements\n- No phase requirements\n- Immediate implementation of his choices\nAdrian (12):\n- No autonomy until age 18\n- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference\n- Must follow rigid phase system\n- Maximum contact permanently reduced\n- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance\n- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice\n2. Documented Impact:\n2023: 66 days of direct father-son time\nCurrent Framework:\n- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly\n- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level\n- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance\n- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time\n3. Mediation Record:\n- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max\n- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality\n- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18\n- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood\n4. Professional Documentation:\n- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.\n- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023\n- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation\n- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule\nYou did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give Adrian\nthe free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence him, but also\ncould create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive \"no.\" Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice from now till\nadulthood,\nI came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this.

Mediation Record:\n- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max\n- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality\n Page 90 of 358\n\n- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18\n- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood\n4. Professional Documentation:\n- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.\n- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023\n- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation\n- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule\nYou did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give\nAdrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence\nhim, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive \"no.\" Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice\nfrom now till adulthood,\nI came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18\nmonths and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.\nOn 12/08/2024 at 07:54 AM, Christine Moyer wrote:\nTo: Robert Moyer (First Viewed: 12/08/2024 at 09:13 AM)\nSubject: Re: What Happened Today\nAdrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice.

I understand what happened. I would not see AD till April at best if I did not give in. You are a great mom. But what I\nasked was if Adrian and Max voted on the plan like usual. I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over.\nHe will reach Max\u2019s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then\nnothing he says will matter. You took that.\nAnd you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me\u2019s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how\nclose you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my\nproposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation.

Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.\n<EndChatGPT/>\n-----------------------------------------------------\nSo..... ... I\u2019ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn\u2019t about me - it\u2019s\nabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to\nchoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own\ndecisions about spending time with me until he\u2019s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it\nback no matter what he does.\nThe hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has\nlost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life \"Sophie's Choice.\" It\u2019s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if\nmy parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as\nthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.\nBTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.",

He had no idea what you scheduled for Adrian today. Fortunately for AD, another child unfortunately was ill. How\nshould I work with you on issues related to him moving forward? Does he know he is coming over here like we discussed with Kari?\nI think that you own the calendar. If that was incorrect, my bad. I desperately want to work with you (across all the things you are unilaterally\ndeciding) and keep asking how, but it feels like I can\u2019t crack the nut. Open to any advice that shows mutual respect and understanding.\nWere you able to speak with your therapist so we could get the green light to work on tools for you and I, like we discussed at hoops?

I know you have a lot of anger, but you slept on the pillow next to me for 25 years and talked about\ngrowing old together. But every night was a lie. Our whole life was a lie. It's hard to ignore.\nI still really wish we would get some help. This way has NOT worked\u2014ever since 2023. Every day that passes under your plan makes it worse,\nand the only thing you do is double down. It's like you want to torment me at this stage.\nI should know just to quit askingm but I feel like I have to at least try for the kid's sake.\nOn 12/28/2024 at 10:53 AM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo: Christine Moyer (First Viewed: Never)\nSubject: Re: Seahawks ticket sale\nI am going to ask that you not start deducting things for me unilaterally.
