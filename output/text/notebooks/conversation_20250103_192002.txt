[Christine Moyer] 07:30 AM - Has not seen big change or reduction in rates post election.Current listings in Kirkland after election, has not seen much activity.Does not anticipate much movement in activity or rates between now and end  year.But could move if priced right.List by date Jan 15 - could sit for a few months if beginning  year.Activity picks up mid Feb/March - there is stigma if sits too long.Recommend wait to list Feb/March/AprilTenant - What options do we want to give him?He is on month to month, would need to give him a 30 day notice.Jeff fered to approach the tenant to discuss options and what he wants. Should time discussion appropriately so tenant does not move tooearly if wants to leave.Stay until it sells?Don't expect too many peopleOnline appointment/need to coordinateStay and perhaps investor? (Mature man/stable job)Vacate?99%  listings for sale, are fering to pay the buyers commission 2.5% to 3%.Buyers' agent - need to have buyers' agreement - this could include buyer pays them 3%.Buyers agent may insist on difference and could be negotiating point for seller to pay the difference, or buyer will pay.Ok. Noting you want to spend the time in mediation to discuss the interpretation. 12/01/2024 at 07:30 AM Christine Moyer Robert Moyer ( 12/01/2024 at 10:56 AM) Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31On 11/30/2024 at 07:49 PM, Robert Moyer wrote: Christine Moyer ( 12/01/2024 at 07:27 AM) Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31Thanks!I am happy to share this with the Lisa (s) and follow whatever interpretation we arrive at.I certainly don't want us to argue over it.

[Robert Moyer] 11:04 AM - That feels like you are posturing and being a little combative. Per the proposal, I’m sharing to provide feedback on the way your note lands with me.I don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads. Thats all.If both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what hedoes.I hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becomingpersonal.Looking forward to a cooperative resolution! 12/01/2024 at 11:04 AM Robert Moyer Christine Moyer ( 12/01/2024 at 02:52 PM) Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31On 12/01/2024 at 07:30 AM, Christine Moyer wrote: Robert Moyer ( 12/01/2024 at 10:56 AM) Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31Ok.

Iconfirmed this is a courtesy and will not impact the current coverage.We will need to split and get own policies for each car, as single driver, so our rates will change.Moving forward, you are  course free to choose whoever you would like for car insurance.The sales fice is closed today but will be calling me tomorrow to set up my separate account for the Subaru.Monthly earthquake insurance is also included in jt payment, so we need to figure out how to split/pay moving forward.Greg provided bill for fixing a hole in the wall for 180. I sent it to you.To approve:Greg is looking into hinges to fix sauna door that snapped over the summer. This can wait closer when we get house ready for sale if you prefer.Kelly/Tom have asked to remove the tree outside our front yard and they will pay. We had it trimmed before but it’s has grown further up and wider.Initially they asked because it was blocking their view but upon inspection roots are breaking up driveway which technically we would need to fix ifdamage gets too bad. We might need to note in sale disclosures if we don’t take care  it now. Kelly has noted it already.Moss/weed removal for yard/driveway etc by gardener and/or Greg. Greg power washed moss last time along driveway. New gardener used by Scott(Quy disappeared) can help with weed removal. This can wait for house sale too. 12/02/2024 at 02:59 PM Christine Moyer Robert Moyer ( 12/02/2024 at 03:55 PM) House repairs/ tree/yard

[Christine Moyer] 10:50 AM - -No mechanism to increase time beyond set scheduleUnequal Treatment  -Brother has full freedom  -He has permanent restrictions  -Different standards for same family  -Can't earn same privileges as MaxLong-term Impact  -Changes relationship with father through childhood  -Can't recover lost time/connection ever  -Must wait until adulthood for autonomy  -Psychological impact  different treatment from brotherUnlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him, evenwell past Max's age:   -Reduce his relationship with his father   -Remove his agency in the relationship   -Create inequality with his brother   -Limit future options until adulthoodThe "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest  his childhood, unlike his brother, whomaintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.<EndChatGPT/>-----------------------------------------------------So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s aboutAdrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to choose hisrelationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own decisions aboutspending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it back no matter what hedoes.The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault  his own, Adrian has lostsomething so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if myparents had tried to explain this kind  logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain  that disparity.

[Christine Moyer] 03:46 PM - And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well when hetold two pressionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.For the record:1. Factual Comparison  Children's Status:Max (16):- Full autonomy over relationship- Direct communication with both parents- Ability to modify contact based on preferences- No supervision requirements- No phase requirements- Immediate implementation  his choicesAdrian (12):- No autonomy until age 18- Cannot modify contact regardless  preference- Must follow rigid phase system- Maximum contact permanently reduced- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice2. Documented Impact:2023: 66 days  direct father-son timeCurrent Framework:- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time3. Mediation Record:- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood4. Pressional Documentation:- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.- Two pressionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023- Their pressional documentation exists independent  any parent's interpretation- The current plan provides no mechanism for pressional recommendations to modify the contact scheduleYou did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give Adrianthe free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence him, but alsocould create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless  either his voice or choice from now tilladulthood,I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18months and hundreds  thousands  dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

He doesn’t.But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are aboutthat. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.It was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will.

This isn’t about me - it’sabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom tochoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his owndecisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get itback no matter what he does.The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault  his own, Adrian haslost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, ifmy parents had tried to explain this kind  logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain  that disparity.

## Thread: It has not been entered into court

[Robert Moyer] 11:13 AM - I was just unclear if it was working properly or not because we had not done it in so long. And the fact that you simply would not answer made methink it was not working.That said, if they were working and you were just ignoring them, I guess it's a moot point. Just let me know.

[Robert Moyer] 12:53 PM - If you think you have zero influence on his thoughts I disagree given the history. But I don’t want to fight. You have made it impossible for him tohave the freedom  choice that Max does at 15 until he is 18. I think my only question was about his vote. Did he vote again on his choice to give upthat free will until he is an adult? He’s a super smart kid and that would be odd… but if he does not want to see me and this really had nothing to dowith our divorce I’ll let Kari know and step away.

So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (myproposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.So just asking - did you take a vote again?On 12/07/2024 at 12:51 PM, Christine Moyer wrote: Robert Moyer ( 12/07/2024 at 12:51 PM) Re: What Happened TodayThe place to discuss was mediation.

Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:<ChatGPT>Let me break down the actual impact:Max: -Complete autonomy over relationship with father -Can choose any amount  time -Can make decisions based on his feelings -No restrictions on contact -No supervision requirements -No phases to progress throughAdrian:Lost significant father son time from even last year  -Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation  -Can't get back to previous level  contact  -Permanently reduced relationship during childhoodNo autonomy  -Can't choose more time like his brother  -Can't request return to previous schedule  -Stuck in rigid structure regardless  wishes  -No mechanism to increase time beyond set scheduleUnequal Treatment  -Brother has full freedom  -He has permanent restrictions  -Different standards for same family  -Can't earn same privileges as MaxLong-term Impact  -Changes relationship with father through childhood  -Can't recover lost time/connection ever Page 92  358  -Must wait until adulthood for autonomy  -Psychological impact  different treatment from brotherUnlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,even well past Max's age:   -Reduce his relationship with his father   -Remove his agency in the relationship   -Create inequality with his brother   -Limit future options until adulthoodThe "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest  his childhood, unlike his brother, whomaintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.<EndChatGPT/>-----------------------------------------------------So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’sabout Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom tochoose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his owndecisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get itback no matter what he does.The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault  his own, Adrian haslost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, ifmy parents had tried to explain this kind  logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain  that disparity. As flawed asthey were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.I sincerely apologize if you feel this is abuse. I was just trying to let you know the facts, because you keep saying everything had been submitted. Ithought you would appreciate it. I will step away and you can believe whatever you like.

[Christine Moyer] 07:54 PM - Kelly/Tom have asked to remove the tree outside our front yard and they will pay. We had it trimmed before but it’s has grown further up andwider. Initially they asked because it was blocking their view but upon inspection roots are breaking up driveway which technically we wouldneed to fix if damage gets too bad. We might need to note in sale disclosures if we don’t take care  it now. Kelly has noted it already.Moss/weed removal for yard/driveway etc by gardener and/or Greg. Greg power washed moss last time along driveway. New gardener used byScott (Quy disappeared) can help with weed removal. This can wait for house sale too.For this Thursday, will Alan pick up from SAAS at 3pm or bus at 3:45? 12/10/2024 at 07:54 PM Christine Moyer Robert Moyer ( 12/10/2024 at 07:56 PM) Re: Sunday Dec 8On 12/06/2024 at 06:31 PM, Robert Moyer wrote: Christine Moyer ( 12/07/2024 at 12:49 PM) Re: Sunday Dec 8Confirmed with Alan.

## Thread: Re: Safeco/Fidelity

[Christine Moyer] 08:40 AM - If you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account . Thatwill be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.In mediation, you had option to transfer some  your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from thosegains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your fer but that wasspeculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was the trade f that wespeculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.I agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date.

I’m trying to navigate if I sellstock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.So this entire situation has been incredibly frustrating for me, and I want to be direct about why. From the very beginning, even in our first meetingswith Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both  us and the estate we leave for our kids. I feel like youknew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on the scoreboard.You and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion  our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been usedfor Mac and AD. This is your area  expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers, and youmanaged those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest  the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t reciprocated when it cameto dividing things up.I understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay f the HELOC, andensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the IRS. Thekids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.I’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so hardto build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even have thisdiscussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31 12/12/2024 at 09:32 AM Robert Moyer Christine Moyer ( 12/12/2024 at 01:10 PM) Re: Safeco/FidelityOn 12/12/2024 at 08:44 AM, Robert Moyer wrote: Christine Moyer ( 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM) Re: Safeco/FidelityJan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial.

From the very beginning, even in our firstmeetings with Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both  us and the estate we leave for our kids. I Page 170  358feel like you knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point onthe scoreboard.You and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion  our money to the government in taxes—money that could have beenused for Mac and AD. This is your area  expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers,and you managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest  the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’treciprocated when it came to dividing things up.I understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay f the HELOC,and ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to theIRS. The kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.I’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked sohard to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to evenhave this discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31On 12/12/2024 at 08:44 AM, Robert Moyer wrote: Christine Moyer ( 12/12/2024 at 03:51 PM) Re: Safeco/FidelityJan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial.

## Thread: Re: Adrian

[Robert Moyer] 05:52 PM - I’m getting worried because I don’t know how you plan to communicate or plan going into a Friday night again. Kari and Alan, and  course ADand me don’t know if plans are changing tomorrow or not.That puts me in an uncomfortable position to try and nudge you given past history and four people could be impacted. I don’t like being the“nudger.” That is why I asked for two minutes on the phone.This makes me feel uncomfortable. 12/13/2024 at 05:52 PM Robert Moyer Christine Moyer ( 12/13/2024 at 07:38 PM) Re: AdrianOn 12/13/2024 at 03:11 PM, Robert Moyer wrote: Christine Moyer ( 12/13/2024 at 07:40 PM) Re: AdrianI don’t know?

Funny to think that is why you made me go to work for Microstmore than two decades ago. Who knew…I never had a say in a single decision for the Seahawks. I asked to have a discussion about this and you refused. By contrast, I took the time and energyto document every single concern you had and even paid you back in realtime rather than argue with you. And then you gave away tickets that youtransferred to me. So now you want $ for tickets that you were able to give away.

If you have a suggestion  something I did not do please bring it up with me.Our history is replete  with me asking to turn the page, do something new together to work on behalf  the kids, at least for their mental health.I stressed this again on the 10th. But you were busy with girls night as your priority. Then I followed up last week addressing every concern you had.Now we have 35 response long OFW thread trying to figure out AD’s time instead  a 30 second phone call. He missed Kari and went home early.“Let me think about it,” that’s all you have said for over a year. My assumption is that it will go for many more years. Nothing changes with you.I am always nice in front  AD, I don’t scream or wag my finger “we are at war.” That’s not good for him. I want him to love the part  them that isyou.How would you like to handle tonight? Do we show him that we put him first? That’s what I would propose. You have seen I do that.

We are adults too, and I am glad sheagrees, but lets take our life back, make decisions on our own in the interests  our kids, and let them help us rather than letting anyone be thepuppet master.I am only asking:- Get you in touch with sound practices- have a pro help us learn how to work togetherWhat is the worst thing that can happen? She says “hey, quit seeking pressional help to be better parents?” I think at that point she actuallytakes over and drives that engagement. That is her job imho. Page 221  358

Please suggestsomething better than what we know works.Happy to resolve our issues, but if it is your prerogative to say that you refuse the organized and structured way that works, it is also mine to pushback on something that clearly does not.Our inability to execute even the most mundane tasks even while I say “screw it, I’ll pay you to make it go away” is a testament to why we need thehelp you have refused for over a year now.I don’t know how many times I have typed up the definition  insanity you used to quote to me, but I know you know it well.

[Robert Moyer] 03:09 PM - Then what did we just do with great effectiveness? We just did it last week. Are we saying that we can never communicate? I’m out if so. I’m notdoing this cross platform multi thread, hair on fire confusion. I am making it crystal clear to you that you don’t read what I send, ask for the wrongthings, and confuse the situation even worse. I simply can’t track so I think we may have just screwed ourselves.The gaslighting is saying you are not secretly involved with Kevin when I have pictures you deny, telling Elsa, Christina, Katherine, Milo when yousaid you had not, that you will accept the plan Dr Brown gave us, that you will correct the TRO that your attorney admitted was a mistake, agreeingto follow Jennifer’s recommendation and then saying your signature means zilch…. I can go on.If you have a single example that Connor says is DV please send the actual text. That’s all I ask. Not you saying it, give me the verbatim example. Andhim saying that example is DV. That’s easy, right?So I assume if this is all we have- there is no “>31” 12/17/2024 at 03:09 PM Robert Moyer Christine Moyer ( 12/17/2024 at 06:00 PM) Re: Running ListOn 12/17/2024 at 02:56 PM, Christine Moyer wrote: Robert Moyer ( 12/17/2024 at 02:58 PM) Re: Running ListWe have to use OFW.The running list meeting was derailed for reasons  you and I disagree on.Saying I refused for a year is gaslighting me without context  what was happening.The DV was real and confirmed.You have all info and feedback on finances as requested.On 12/17/2024 at 12:55 PM, Robert Moyer wrote: Christine Moyer ( 12/17/2024 at 02:41 PM) Running ListYou have threads and asks across two platforms and multiple entries.

Unfortunate, given how well OFW onlyhas worked thus far (not at all). But you two sure showed me for trying to help.It's weird. I sit with you at at hoops, talk about all the ways I want to help—I have sent so many ways I tried already—and explain that if you just letme, we can start working together (ex: kid's insurance.)

[Robert Moyer] 11:16 AM - I think we had sent questions to Natalie about you making all the changes that you said I made to our accounts. You were actually kind enough tosend the dashboard that showed you were not telling the truth. That made it super simple to sus you out.As noted, you secretly initiated email changes to both  my email accounts and I immediately noticed that changes had been made that were screencaptured. If we should revisit what you did, I’ll be happy to ask Lisa to get your answers  from Natalie.Neither account has behaved the same since and I had hoped it was juts an innocent mistake.

These are killing me.I'd like Thursday, skip Friday and bank it for the 45-day hold in the PP, and have Sat as planned.I'd like to get back to Alan today since this is his holiday too, and I want to be respectful  that.Thanks! 12/22/2024 at 12:23 PM Robert Moyer Christine Moyer ( 12/22/2024 at 01:19 PM) Re: AlanOn 12/21/2024 at 02:37 PM, Robert Moyer wrote: Christine Moyer ( Never) Re: AlanAlan said that Sat he should be with me too according to his accounting.On 12/21/2024 at 02:36 PM, Christine Moyer wrote: Robert Moyer ( 12/21/2024 at 02:36 PM) AlanCan you confirm dates you have?I have down 26, 27.What do you have for after that?

[Robert Moyer] 09:57 AM - Thank you.So....I am hoping that since I did all  our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback f you this year. I brought it up, and Ithink you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a sleepover.This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?Merry Christmas to the Moyer's.

It’s not really fair to couch me that way.Also not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was kindateasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.Maybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind  clown.

I asked you about:- Today's 40-minute delay which impacts my limited time with Adrian and has significant financial implications at $1k a day.- The portrayal to Adrian that I "won't reply" about visits misrepresents my efforts and damages my relationship with him.- Emergency communication protocols are a standard safety consideration, and you allow for no way to accommodate them.- The concerning shift in Adrian's view  MIT from pride to mockery between visits suggests harmful negative influences on him. 12/28/2024 at 10:48 AM Robert Moyer Christine Moyer ( Never) Re: AD is asleep Page 341  358

[Christine Moyer] 04:06 PM - - Paper & Electronic 125000024     - Wires 026009593I admit I am struggling, knowing you freely say you lied to me for 30 years. That is most  my life, and I have to start all over now. And I stillcan't get you to even work with me on rebuilding and being civil—even for the kid's sake.I have asked every way I know how. I know you have a lot  anger, but you slept on the pillow next to me for 25 years and talked aboutgrowing old together. But every night was a lie. Our whole life was a lie. It's hard to ignore.I still really wish we would get some help. This way has NOT worked—ever since 2023. Every day that passes under your plan makes it worse,and the only thing you do is double down. It's like you want to torment me at this stage.I should know just to quit askingm but I feel like I have to at least try for the kid's sake.On 12/28/2024 at 10:53 AM, Robert Moyer wrote: Christine Moyer ( Never) Re: Seahawks ticket saleI am going to ask that you not start deducting things for me unilaterally.
