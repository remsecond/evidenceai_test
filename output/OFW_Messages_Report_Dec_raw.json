Noting you want to spend the time in mediation to discuss the interpretation.\nOn 11/30/2024 at 07:49 PM, Robert Moyer wrote:\nTo: Christine Moyer (First Viewed: 12/01/2024 at 07:27 AM)\nSubject: Re: Expenses prior to Oct 31\nThanks!\nI am happy to share this with the Lisa (s) and follow whatever interpretation we arrive at.\nI certainly don't want us to argue over it.
