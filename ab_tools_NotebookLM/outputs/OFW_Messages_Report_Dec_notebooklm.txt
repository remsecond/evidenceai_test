I think I’m happy with the legwork you did with Jeff.
Want to just bait till the same list window for the house? We can decide then if we like?

Subject: Condo Sale
Questions:
Is Jan 15th listing a hard list date or open to list Spring (Feb/March/April) based on Jeff recommendation.
Home/Condo Sale agreement - Suggest add language "List by Jan 15th, or based on list date recommended by agent"
Jeff Conversation Summary
 Page 1 of 358

Page 2:
----------------------------------------
Has not seen big change or reduction in rates post election.
Current listings in Kirkland after election, has not seen much activity.
Does not anticipate much movement in activity or rates between now and end of year.
But could move if priced right.
List by date Jan 15 - could sit for a few months if beginning of year.
Activity picks up mid Feb/March - there is stigma if sits too long.
Recommend wait to list Feb/March/April
Tenant - What options do we want to give him?
He is on month to month, would need to give him a 30 day notice.
Jeff offered to approach the tenant to discuss options and what he wants. Should time discussion appropriately so tenant does not move too
early if wants to leave.
Stay until it sells?
Don't expect too many people
Online appointment/need to coordinate
Stay and perhaps investor? (Mature man/stable job)
Vacate?
99% of listings for sale, are offering to pay the buyers commission 2.5% to 3%.
Buyers' agent - need to have buyers' agreement - this could include buyer pays them 3%.
Buyers agent may insist on difference and could be negotiating point for seller to pay the difference, or buyer will pay.

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.

Message 4 of 287
That feels like you are posturing and being a little combative. Per the proposal, I’m sharing to provide feedback on the way your note lands with me.
I don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads. Thats all.
If both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what he
does.
I hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming
personal.
Looking forward to a cooperative resolution!

Message 5 of 287
So, I assume that the mediation on the 5th might impact plans. But agree having a loosely defined framework makes sense.
My first reaction is that b-ball will be after the visit. Perhaps we work backwards and use hoops as the handoff that night. Thoughts?
Let’s please afford the opportunity to re-evaluate if new information surfaces as was the case in our last mediation agreement. Agree?Sent: 12/01/2024 at 11:08 AM

Safeco called me back and I spoke to Alex.
509 608 4742
My take away.
As you are not at the Kirkland residence, you would need to call and request separate policy for your car at existing residence. I can’t do it as I am still
in the Kirkland residence.
I would remain on existing policy, but my rate would adjust after you drop off.
We would then need to figure split payment of earthquake or I guess we could request that be a separate policy too and figure out payment.
Autopayment is on hold until Dec 10th as a courtesy. Lmk thoughts.Sent: 12/02/2024 at 01:11 PM

SafeCo is billed to the Jt Account - with your portion being larger than mine. The breakdown for the amount has been shared on multiple
occasions.
All attempts and requests for reimbursement to the jt account for your larger share, as far back at Aug 16, have been ignored. My only solution
now is to formally split it.

I called SafeCo to understand how to split our car insurance policies.
It was set up for auto deduct on Monday, Dec 2 from jt bank account - they have paused until Dec 12th, so give us time to figure it out. I
confirmed this is a courtesy and will not impact the current coverage.
We will need to split and get own policies for each car, as single driver, so our rates will change.
Moving forward, you are of course free to choose whoever you would like for car insurance.
The sales office is closed today but will be calling me tomorrow to set up my separate account for the Subaru.

I’m ok doing that for now assuming there is no dispute about amounts or it just gets messy staying in this state.
I left message for Alex to have autopayment pull from jt account on Dec 10.
See Safeco tab in the shared workbook which breaks it down. Yours is 532, mine is 225. We should both deposit that in the joint account.
You had requested the SafeCo breakdown in an email sent by your lawyers during the last mediation.
Can you confirm no further questions or issues on this. If you are good, I’ll transfer my share into BofA.Sent: 12/02/2024 at 02:47 PM

school pics, and I had sent you link to download when it was purchased, check 3986, 60.55 for back flow assembly test, check 3987, this was carpet
cleaning prior to your home inspector. I printed both checks into “BankofAnerica questions” tab. I had asked previously if any concerns/questions,
you said no but let me know if anything further.

Safeco called me back and I spoke to Alex.
509 608 4742
My take away.
As you are not at the Kirkland residence, you would need to call and request separate policy for your car at existing residence. I can’t do it as I
am still in the Kirkland residence.
I would remain on existing policy, but my rate would adjust after you drop off.
We would then need to figure split payment of earthquake or I guess we could request that be a separate policy too and figure out payment.
Autopayment is on hold until Dec 10th as a courtesy. Lmk thoughts.

SafeCo is billed to the Jt Account - with your portion being larger than mine. The breakdown for the amount has been shared on multiple
occasions.
All attempts and requests for reimbursement to the jt account for your larger share, as far back at Aug 16, have been ignored. My only solution
now is to formally split it.

Why would we do this before we are divorced? Are you just intentionally trying to cost us more? I don’t get you. First I offer anyway possible
not to move the boys just for their own good and you won’t let me keep you in the house even when you benefit, you have to make a big deal

I called SafeCo to understand how to split our car insurance policies.
It was set up for auto deduct on Monday, Dec 2 from jt bank account - they have paused until Dec 12th, so give us time to figure it out. I
confirmed this is a courtesy and will not impact the current coverage.
We will need to split and get own policies for each car, as single driver, so our rates will change.
Moving forward, you are of course free to choose whoever you would like for car insurance.
The sales office is closed today but will be calling me tomorrow to set up my separate account for the Subaru.
Monthly earthquake insurance is also included in jt payment, so we need to figure out how to split/pay moving forward.

Greg provided bill for fixing a hole in the wall for 180. I sent it to you.
To approve:
Greg is looking into hinges to fix sauna door that snapped over the summer. This can wait closer when we get house ready for sale if you prefer.
Kelly/Tom have asked to remove the tree outside our front yard and they will pay. We had it trimmed before but it’s has grown further up and wider.
Initially they asked because it was blocking their view but upon inspection roots are breaking up driveway which technically we would need to fix if
damage gets too bad. We might need to note in sale disclosures if we don’t take care of it now. Kelly has noted it already.
Moss/weed removal for yard/driveway etc by gardener and/or Greg. Greg power washed moss last time along driveway. New gardener used by Scott
(Quy disappeared) can help with weed removal. This can wait for house sale too.Sent: 12/02/2024 at 02:59 PM

I'm working on this today now that Lisa Summers is back, But I'll be honest it's very difficult to understand exactly what's going on here. We have
discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.
When I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the language

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.

So, I assume that the mediation on the 5th might impact plans. But agree having a loosely defined framework makes sense.
My first reaction is that b-ball will be after the visit. Perhaps we work backwards and use hoops as the handoff that night. Thoughts?
Let’s please afford the opportunity to re-evaluate if new information surfaces as was the case in our last mediation agreement. Agree?

We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
 -Complete autonomy over relationship with father
 -Can choose any amount of time
 -Can make decisions based on his feelings
 -No restrictions on contact
 -No supervision requirements
 -No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
  -Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
  -Can't get back to previous level of contact
  -Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
  -Can't choose more time like his brother
  -Can't request return to previous schedule
  -Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishesSent: 12/06/2024 at 02:10 AM

Subject: What Happened Today
 Page 25 of 358

Page 26:
----------------------------------------
  -No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
Unequal Treatment
  -Brother has full freedom
  -He has permanent restrictions
  -Different standards for same family
  -Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
  -Changes relationship with father through childhood
  -Can't recover lost time/connection ever
  -Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
  -Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him, even
well past Max's age:
   -Reduce his relationship with his father
   -Remove his agency in the relationship
   -Create inequality with his brother
   -Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.
<EndChatGPT/>
-----------------------------------------------------
So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s about
Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to choose his
relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own decisions about
spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it back no matter what he
does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has lost
something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if my
parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as they were,
they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

I am not disagreeing. I understand what happened. I would not see AD till April at best if I did not give in. You are a great mom. But what I asked was
if Adrian and Max voted on the plan like usual. I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over. He will reach
Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then nothing he says will
matter. You took that.
And you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how close you
and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my proposal btw)
but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.

Adrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his communications to others, not just me.
I was not privy to communications to you in mediation about April timeframe. Your lawyer was aware of the legal ramifications going into mediation
so there should have been no surprise.
Below is blaming me again.

Subject: What Happened Today
We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
 -Complete autonomy over relationship with father
 -Can choose any amount of time
 -Can make decisions based on his feelings
 -No restrictions on contact
 -No supervision requirements
 -No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
  -Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
  -Can't get back to previous level of contact
  -Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
 Page 37 of 358

Page 38:
----------------------------------------
No autonomy
  -Can't choose more time like his brother
  -Can't request return to previous schedule
  -Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
  -No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
Unequal Treatment
  -Brother has full freedom
  -He has permanent restrictions
  -Different standards for same family
  -Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
  -Changes relationship with father through childhood
  -Can't recover lost time/connection ever
  -Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
  -Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
   -Reduce his relationship with his father
   -Remove his agency in the relationship
   -Create inequality with his brother
   -Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.
<EndChatGPT/>
-----------------------------------------------------
So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to
choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has
lost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if
my parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as
they were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well when he
told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:
1. Factual Comparison of Children's Status:
Max (16):
- Full autonomy over relationship
- Direct communication with both parents
- Ability to modify contact based on preferences
- No supervision requirements
- No phase requirements
- Immediate implementation of his choices
Adrian (12):
- No autonomy until age 18
- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference
- Must follow rigid phase system
- Maximum contact permanently reduced
- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance
- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice
2. Documented Impact:
2023: 66 days of direct father-son time
Current Framework:
- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly
- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level
- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance
- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time
3. Mediation Record:
- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max
- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality
- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18
- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood
4. Professional Documentation:
- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.
- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023
- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation
- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule
You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give Adrian
the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence him, but also
could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice from now till
adulthood,
I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18
months and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

He will reach Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then
nothing he says will matter. You took that.
And you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how
close you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my

we meditate it is inherently adversarial. No child ever benefits from his parents fighting. Ever.
Before this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18. Something
that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.
But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are about
that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.

Adrian's voice is your voice. You don't know what he says to me or to Kari. You have done this since we were best friends. But you destroyed
that. And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well
when he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:
1. Factual Comparison of Children's Status:
Max (16):
- Full autonomy over relationship
- Direct communication with both parents
- Ability to modify contact based on preferences
- No supervision requirements
- No phase requirements
- Immediate implementation of his choices
Adrian (12):
- No autonomy until age 18
- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference
- Must follow rigid phase system
- Maximum contact permanently reduced
- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance
- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice
2. Documented Impact:
2023: 66 days of direct father-son time
 Page 50 of 358

Page 51:
----------------------------------------
Current Framework:
- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly
- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level
- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance
- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time
3. Mediation Record:
- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max
- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality
- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18
- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood
4. Professional Documentation:
- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.
- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023
- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation
- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule
You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give
Adrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence

We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
 -Complete autonomy over relationship with father
 -Can choose any amount of time
 -Can make decisions based on his feelings
 -No restrictions on contact
 -No supervision requirements
 -No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
  -Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
  -Can't get back to previous level of contact
  -Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
  -Can't choose more time like his brother
  -Can't request return to previous schedule
  -Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
  -No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
 Page 52 of 358

Page 53:
----------------------------------------
Unequal Treatment
  -Brother has full freedom
  -He has permanent restrictions
  -Different standards for same family
  -Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
  -Changes relationship with father through childhood
  -Can't recover lost time/connection ever
  -Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
  -Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
   -Reduce his relationship with his father
   -Remove his agency in the relationship
   -Create inequality with his brother
   -Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.

So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to
choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has

close you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my
proposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.
So just asking - did you take a vote again?

Subject: What Happened Today
We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
 -Complete autonomy over relationship with father
 -Can choose any amount of time
 -Can make decisions based on his feelings
 -No restrictions on contact
 -No supervision requirements
 -No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
  -Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
  -Can't get back to previous level of contact
  -Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
  -Can't choose more time like his brother
  -Can't request return to previous schedule
  -Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
  -No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
Unequal Treatment
  -Brother has full freedom
  -He has permanent restrictions
  -Different standards for same family
  -Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
  -Changes relationship with father through childhood
  -Can't recover lost time/connection ever
  -Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
  -Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
   -Reduce his relationship with his father
   -Remove his agency in the relationship
   -Create inequality with his brother
   -Limit future options until adulthood
 Page 61 of 358

Page 62:
----------------------------------------
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.
<EndChatGPT/>
-----------------------------------------------------
So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to
choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has
lost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if
my parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as
they were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

Before this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18.
Something that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.
But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are
about that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.
It was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were
“real kids.”
This is 100x that. They are blood brothers. And this is their parents. Talk about really doubting your identity. It can’t get more authentic than
that.
It’s been a long hard 18 months. Natalie will be a distant memory when AD turns 16 and can drive, but has no rights on his parenting plan. I’m
asking if we can reach a peaceful solution for both their sake. Please stand back from the fury of the battlefield and let’s consider a
compassionate and durable decision.
This is only a win or loss for Adrian. Our baby.

Adrian's voice is your voice. You don't know what he says to me or to Kari. You have done this since we were best friends. But you destroyed
that. And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well
when he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:
1. Factual Comparison of Children's Status:
Max (16):
- Full autonomy over relationship
- Direct communication with both parents
- Ability to modify contact based on preferences
- No supervision requirements
- No phase requirements
- Immediate implementation of his choices
Adrian (12):
 Page 63 of 358

Page 64:
----------------------------------------
- No autonomy until age 18
- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference
- Must follow rigid phase system
- Maximum contact permanently reduced
- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance
- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice
2. Documented Impact:
2023: 66 days of direct father-son time
Current Framework:
- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly
- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level
- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance
- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time
3. Mediation Record:
- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max
- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality
- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18
- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood
4. Professional Documentation:
- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.
- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023
- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation
- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule
You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give
Adrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence
him, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice
from now till adulthood,
I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18
months and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

If you don’t let me chat , you see blame, because that is what you are making up. I am not blaming you. I am asking for a peaceful and
constructive discussion. May we please take a minute to even check if
It’s worth a longer conversation.

Would you like to chat for a minute. Just you and me, taking our kids best interests in mind? I am not trying to coerce or arm twist. But frankly
when we meditate it is inherently adversarial. No child ever benefits from his parents fighting. Ever.
Before this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18.
Something that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.
But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are
about that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.
It was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were
“real kids.”
This is 100x that. They are blood brothers. And this is their parents. Talk about really doubting your identity. It can’t get more authentic than
that.
It’s been a long hard 18 months. Natalie will be a distant memory when AD turns 16 and can drive, but has no rights on his parenting plan. I’m
asking if we can reach a peaceful solution for both their sake. Please stand back from the fury of the battlefield and let’s consider a
compassionate and durable decision.

Adrian's voice is your voice. You don't know what he says to me or to Kari. You have done this since we were best friends. But you destroyed
that. And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well
when he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:
1. Factual Comparison of Children's Status:
Max (16):
- Full autonomy over relationship
- Direct communication with both parents
- Ability to modify contact based on preferences
- No supervision requirements
- No phase requirements
- Immediate implementation of his choices
Adrian (12):
- No autonomy until age 18
- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference
- Must follow rigid phase system
- Maximum contact permanently reduced
- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance
- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice
2. Documented Impact:
2023: 66 days of direct father-son time
Current Framework:
- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly
- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level
- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance
- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time
 Page 73 of 358

Page 74:
----------------------------------------
3. Mediation Record:
- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max
- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality
- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18
- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood
4. Professional Documentation:
- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.
- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023
- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation
- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule
You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give
Adrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence
him, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice
from now till adulthood,
I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18
months and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

asked was if Adrian and Max voted on the plan like usual. I need to work with professionals to tell Adrian his childhood with me is largely over.
He will reach Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then
nothing he says will matter. You took that.
And you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how
close you and Max are and how close mini-me and I were. So those should be interesting teen years deciphering how Max got free will at 15 (my
proposal btw) but Adrian gets nothing at all- zero (your demand) Oh I am very clear about what you did in mediation. Crystal clear.
So just asking - did you take a vote again?

Subject: What Happened Today
We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
 -Complete autonomy over relationship with father
 -Can choose any amount of time
 -Can make decisions based on his feelings
 -No restrictions on contact
 -No supervision requirements
 -No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
  -Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
  -Can't get back to previous level of contact
  -Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
  -Can't choose more time like his brother
  -Can't request return to previous schedule
  -Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
  -No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
Unequal Treatment
  -Brother has full freedom
  -He has permanent restrictions
 Page 75 of 358

Page 76:
----------------------------------------
  -Different standards for same family
  -Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
  -Changes relationship with father through childhood
  -Can't recover lost time/connection ever
  -Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
  -Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
   -Reduce his relationship with his father
   -Remove his agency in the relationship
   -Create inequality with his brother
   -Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.
<EndChatGPT/>
-----------------------------------------------------
So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to
choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has
lost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if
my parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as
they were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.
Message 53 of 287
Allright. I can't fight any harder for mini-me at this point if you won't entertain the option of equality between, he and Max. Legally you can do
whatever you want to him.
I just noted earlier you had said that "Adrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his
communications to others, not just me."
So given your statement, and the disparity of how your parent each of them, I thought it was worth a try. You have made it clear- Max has free will.

when we meditate it is inherently adversarial. No child ever benefits from his parents fighting. Ever.
Before this goes into the court to be signed into canon law perhaps we see if there is a solution that does not take Adrian’s agency till 18.
Something that allows for our boys to say they were treated the same. If he does not want to see me, that’s fine. He doesn’t.
But taking his free will and choice while Max had his for four years is something that I think you will regret knowing how passionate you are
about that. I’ll do what I can do to give him free will again. Just the same as Max has,  nothing more or less.
It was pretty devastating to Michael and to see the Ashbury kids treated so differently in the will. Deep pain that made us question if we were
“real kids.”
This is 100x that. They are blood brothers. And this is their parents. Talk about really doubting your identity. It can’t get more authentic than
that.
It’s been a long hard 18 months. Natalie will be a distant memory when AD turns 16 and can drive, but has no rights on his parenting plan. I’m
asking if we can reach a peaceful solution for both their sake. Please stand back from the fury of the battlefield and let’s consider a
compassionate and durable decision.

Adrian's voice is your voice. You don't know what he says to me or to Kari. You have done this since we were best friends. But you destroyed
that. And now tell me you know what he really wants more than what two adults actually hear with our ears. You did that this summer as well
when he told two professionals the same story and then you denied that. And to factual, honesty and transparency is not your strong suite.
For the record:
1. Factual Comparison of Children's Status:
Max (16):
- Full autonomy over relationship
- Direct communication with both parents
- Ability to modify contact based on preferences
- No supervision requirements
- No phase requirements
- Immediate implementation of his choices
Adrian (12):
- No autonomy until age 18
- Cannot modify contact regardless of preference
- Must follow rigid phase system
- Maximum contact permanently reduced
- Cannot return to previous relationship level even with perfect compliance
- Will be older than Max's current age before having any choice
2. Documented Impact:
2023: 66 days of direct father-son time
Current Framework:
- Phase I: 8 supervised hours bi-weekly
- Maximum (Phase IV): Significantly reduced from previous level
- Required waiting period: Minimum 240 days with perfect compliance
- Net reduction: Approximately 82% decrease in father-son time
3. Mediation Record:
- I specifically requested Adrian be given the same autonomy as Max
 Page 84 of 358

Page 85:
----------------------------------------
- This request was explicitly denied by you not to grant that equality
- The result is a permanent restriction on Adrian's relationship choices until age 18
- This creates a documented disparity between siblings that will last Adrian's entire remaining childhood
4. Professional Documentation:
- Our reunification counselor said the status quo at best is life support, nothing more.
- Two professionals received direct communication from Adrian in Summer 2023
- Their professional documentation exists independent of any parent's interpretation
- The current plan provides no mechanism for professional recommendations to modify the contact schedule
You did this. Let's not play with what was said in mediation. I was super clear, unambiguous, that at a minimum, could we at least please give
Adrian the free will that Max has? They are brother's and given that your closeness to Max and mine to Adrain, this disparity not only silence
him, but also could create a crisis in the future. The answer was a definitive "no." Adrian will be restricted regardless of either his voice or choice
from now till adulthood,
I came in with Connor's plan. Yours was far worse, and that is what you go. I will not permit you to alter history. You did this. After the last 18
months and hundreds of thousands of dollars, your grand accomplishment was to give Max free will and take away Adrian's till he is an adult.

He will reach Max’s age and it will come and go. Then it will be three years later, only when is an adult, will he get to find his voice. Till then

And you took it from only Adrian. You took mini-me’s free will. You denied him agency for the rest of his childhood. And we all know how

Subject: What Happened Today
We should decide how we constructively address today. Ran our plan through ChatGPT for fun:
<ChatGPT>
Let me break down the actual impact:
Max:
 -Complete autonomy over relationship with father
 -Can choose any amount of time
 -Can make decisions based on his feelings
 -No restrictions on contact
 -No supervision requirements
 -No phases to progress through
Adrian:
Lost significant father son time from even last year
  -Went from 66 days solo to limited visitation
  -Can't get back to previous level of contact
  -Permanently reduced relationship during childhood
No autonomy
  -Can't choose more time like his brother
  -Can't request return to previous schedule
  -Stuck in rigid structure regardless of wishes
  -No mechanism to increase time beyond set schedule
Unequal Treatment
  -Brother has full freedom
  -He has permanent restrictions
 Page 86 of 358

Page 87:
----------------------------------------
  -Different standards for same family
  -Can't earn same privileges as Max
Long-term Impact
  -Changes relationship with father through childhood
  -Can't recover lost time/connection ever
  -Must wait until adulthood for autonomy
  -Psychological impact of different treatment from brother
Unlike his brother, Max, this shows that rather than Adrian being protected, his free will as a child has been permanently taken away from him,
even well past Max's age:
   -Reduce his relationship with his father
   -Remove his agency in the relationship
   -Create inequality with his brother
   -Limit future options until adulthood
The "protections" are actually restrictions that fundamentally alter his access to his father for the rest of his childhood, unlike his brother, who
maintains full autonomy and control. Comparatively, Adrian has lost his relationship with his father while Max decides what he likes.
<EndChatGPT/>
-----------------------------------------------------
So..... ... I’ve been thinking about how to explain to Adrian what happened today in a way that he can understand. This isn’t about me - it’s
about Adrian never being able to have more time with his father, no matter what he wants or does, ever. Unlike Max, who has full freedom to
choose his relationship with me, Adrian is now permanently restricted. He has no way to ask for more, return to what we had, or make his own
decisions about spending time with me until he’s an adult. His childhood as it was, is effectively over today, with no way for him to ever get it
back no matter what he does.
The hardest part is explaining why one brother has full autonomy and the other has zero - and how, through no fault of his own, Adrian has
lost something so irreplaceable forever. Agreeing to this was a real-life "Sophie's Choice." It’s going to be such a tough conversation. One that, if
my parents had tried to explain this kind of logic to Michael and me, no message could have soothed the pain of that disparity. As flawed as
they were, they had the decency to understand what that would do to us.
BTW- did you have them vote on this again? If so, no explanation necessary.

If you think you have zero influence on his thoughts I disagree given the history. But I don’t want to fight. You have made it impossible for him to
have the freedom of choice that Max does at 15 until he is 18. I think my only question was about his vote. Did he vote again on his choice to give up
that free will until he is an adult? He’s a super smart kid and that would be odd… but if he does not want to see me and this really had nothing to do

Allright. I can't fight any harder for mini-me at this point if you won't entertain the option of equality between, he and Max. Legally you can
do whatever you want to him.
I just noted earlier you had said that "Adrian has been expressing how he feels, continues to, and has found his voice. You saw that in his
communications to others, not just me."
So given your statement, and the disparity of how your parent each of them, I thought it was worth a try. You have made it clear- Max has free
will. AD and his voice will be silent.

I’ll review the invoices and pay the larger amount.
There are some other documents that need to be completed that I will be sending over.
I also have the whistler place for the weekend and plan to take the boys. I’ll send over the travel authorization as well.

Yes but Dec 20-23 falls during the winter break.
In mediation I specifically asked Judge Rosen as I thought we had to negotiate these dates to take boys to Whistler. He confirmed I did not as it fell

Safeco payment of 756.50 is due on the 12th and will pull from the jt Bank of America account. I just deposited my portion of 225. Can you do your
portion of 532?
The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the cash
balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell stock now

The holidays take priority over regular time.
So if one of us gets Spring break, winter break etc, it would not be interrupted if one of us has that weekend.
If you disagree, I can send my travel authorization via Natalie and Lisa can respond with your interpretation.
I would prefer not to argue here. That’s what Natalie and I very specifically discussed with Rosen that I would get that weekend as I have boys over

I don't want to argue, either. And you went straight to the lawyers in this instead of even asking if we could work together. That mode won't help us
unless Natalie is on a permanent retainer, so you can always go after me. I am suggesting a path forward of compromise and solutions.
The SAAS calendar explicitly states that Winter Break starts on December 23, 2024, which suggests that December 21–22 is still part of the regular
schedule, not Winter Break. If the weekend should not be interrupted, then it has to start for it not to be interrupted.

The SAAS calendar explicitly states that Winter Break starts on December 23, 2024, which suggests that December 21–22 is still part of the
regular schedule, not Winter Break. If the weekend should not be interrupted, then it has to start for it not to be interrupted.
Let's not be jerks to each other. Would you prefer to insist that Winter Break starts before Winter Break or work together?

The holidays take priority over regular time.
So if one of us gets Spring break, winter break etc, it would not be interrupted if one of us has that weekend.
If you disagree, I can send my travel authorization via Natalie and Lisa can respond with your interpretation.
I would prefer not to argue here. That’s what Natalie and I very specifically discussed with Rosen that I would get that weekend as I have boys
over Winter Break.

Yes but Dec 20-23 falls during the winter break.
In mediation I specifically asked Judge Rosen as I thought we had to negotiate these dates to take boys to Whistler. He confirmed I did not as it
fell during winter break which overrides the regular schedule. I asked him to communicate that to your side.

Oct 31st. Current total is 2,417. There could be more. Seattle children’s still shows amounts pending insurance.
That note was because you had said no to paying for your portion of medical and then pushed back on other expenses I had included.

I'm working on this today now that Lisa Summers is back, But I'll be honest it's very difficult to understand exactly what's going on here. We
have discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.
When I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the
language used in those tabs feels combative. I'm letting you know that this situation is very difficult to sort out.
I am trying to work with you, but it feels like an evidence gathering exercise in "gotcha accounting" sometimes. Just giving you my feedback as I
suggested so we can do this in a constructive way.

That feels like you are posturing and being a little combative. Per the proposal, I’m sharing to provide feedback on the way your note lands
with me.
I don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads.
Thats all.
If both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what
he does.
I hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming
personal.
Looking forward to a cooperative resolution!

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.

need to fix if damage gets too bad. We might need to note in sale disclosures if we don’t take care of it now. Kelly has noted it already.
Moss/weed removal for yard/driveway etc by gardener and/or Greg. Greg power washed moss last time along driveway. New gardener used by
Scott (Quy disappeared) can help with weed removal. This can wait for house sale too.

I'm working on this today now that Lisa Summers is back, But I'll be honest it's very difficult to understand exactly what's going on here. We
have discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.
When I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the
language used in those tabs feels combative. I'm letting you know that this situation is very difficult to sort out.
I am trying to work with you, but it feels like an evidence gathering exercise in "gotcha accounting" sometimes. Just giving you my feedback as I
suggested so we can do this in a constructive way.

I don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads.
Thats all.
If both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what
he does.
I hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming
personal.
Looking forward to a cooperative resolution!

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.
Confirming if you want to address in mediation next week, and I will make a note to Natalie.

I think the number left for me after those is anything above $250. If that is incorrect, please let me know. I realize I still have some things that

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the next
bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis
But before I do this, will you even consider a "Jan 01" sale instead if it saves us some money?

Safeco-
For the 12th, I deposited $756.50 today
For the 02nd, I deposited $756.50 today
BofA-
I think the number left for me after those is anything above $250. If that is incorrect, please let me know. I realize I still have some things that
pull from that, so I did not want to yank mine yet.
$300k-
I planned on hitting my deadline, but if I can do something to help you, I'll come in on a different day. I am more than happy to see how I can
help you.

Safeco payment of 756.50 is due on the 12th and will pull from the jt Bank of America account. I just deposited my portion of 225. Can you
do your portion of 532?
The next payment will be due on Jan 2.
I want to make sure there is sufficient funds for check for Max’s passport clears.
Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the
cash balance and if we use to settle HELOC as you suggest.
Your cash transfer to me of approx 300k is due by end of year. Do you have a sense if I will receive that earlier? I’m trying to navigate if I sell
stock now to pay bills or just wait for the cash.

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis
But before I do this, will you even consider a "Jan 01" sale instead if it saves us some money?

I mentioned that it was hard to understand. Just giving me the totals I owe is still not great. Can you enumerate line items in such a way that I
can have Lisa compare to our agreement? Even if it is just a screen cap of the excel sheet that I noted that I was struggling with.

Oct 31st. Current total is 2,417. There could be more. Seattle children’s still shows amounts pending insurance.
That note was because you had said no to paying for your portion of medical and then pushed back on other expenses I had included.
Just let me know if you still have that interpretation.

I'm working on this today now that Lisa Summers is back, But I'll be honest it's very difficult to understand exactly what's going on here. We
have discussions in email and then you crossover to Ofw and I think I'm expected to understand the join in your mind.
When I go into the spreadsheet, I see an October page but I also see pages that frankly feel borderline caustic and confrontational. Even the
language used in those tabs feels combative. I'm letting you know that this situation is very difficult to sort out.
I am trying to work with you, but it feels like an evidence gathering exercise in "gotcha accounting" sometimes. Just giving you my feedback as I
suggested so we can do this in a constructive way.

I don’t think I said I what you are stating below. I said I would ask the Lisa(s) and am more than happy to go along with the plan as it reads.

If both sides legal counsel think it reads differently, then yes, it might be something we need a mediators sage advice to adjudicate. That’s what
he does.
I hope this helps. And as we discussed, the most important thing is mutual respect, and space to have a different opinion without it becoming
personal.
Looking forward to a cooperative resolution!

Per spreadsheet this is currently $2,417.
Lisa included the language in the draft docs sent over last week "reserve all other past due expenses prior to 10/31/24" but it seems you have a
different interpretation of what this means, or maybe and Lisa are aligned it does not cover what I sent you for expenses totaling 2,417.
Confirming if you want to address in mediation next week, and I will make a note to Natalie.

Our agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.
I’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt fidelity.
You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.
Washington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.
That might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.Sent: 12/12/2024 at 06:58 AM

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis
But before I do this, will you even consider a "Jan 01" sale instead if it saves us some money?

If you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account . That
will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.
In mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from those
gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer but that was
speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was the trade off that we
speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.
I agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.Sent: 12/12/2024 at 08:40 AM

I’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt

You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.
Washington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.
That might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.

Jan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?
Then it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.

So this entire situation has been incredibly frustrating for me, and I want to be direct about why. From the very beginning, even in our first meetings
with Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I feel like you
knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on the scoreboard.
You and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been used
for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers, and you
managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t reciprocated when it came
to dividing things up.
I understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC, and
ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the IRS. The
kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.
I’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so hard
to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even have this
discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31Sent: 12/12/2024 at 09:32 AM

Specific to the 300k... I am running some numbers.
Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.
<<Caveat: I know I am mixing annual income with realized gains and need to distinguish:>>
- Ordinary Income (Your salary: $226,000)
- Capital Gains (which are taxed differently)
- The equalization payment tax treatment
- Tax rate on past sales based on cost basis
But before I do this, will you even consider a "Jan 01" sale instead if it saves us some money?

So this entire situation has been incredibly frustrating for me, and I want to be direct about why. From the very beginning, even in our first
meetings with Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I
feel like you knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on
the scoreboard.
You and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been
used for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers,
and you managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t
reciprocated when it came to dividing things up.
I understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC,
and ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the
IRS. The kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.
I’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so
hard to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even
have this discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31

Jan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?
Then it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.
If you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.
Is that correct?

If you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account .
That will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.
In mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from
those gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer
but that was speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was
the trade off that we speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.
I agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.

Our agreement for 2024, even though we file joint, we pay taxes based on what issued to us.
I’ll pay on my w2 and get credit for any withholding, my capital gains from my stock sales, and will take my share of capital losses from the jt
fidelity.
You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.
Washington state has capital gains tax for amounts greater than 250k as well for this and next year.
That might factor into your calc for next year once we sell the home.

And tbh- it’s more frustrating because we could not ever talk, even as I practically begged you at ADs basketball game. I approached you in the gym
and asked you. Then after. It’s in OFW. I tried so hard V.
And per below I was told that you were not asking for spousal support. I didn’t refuse it. I did not even counter on your last offer for child support, I
said it’s not worth it “I want her to have it for the kids.”
I have agreed to pay for Max’s medical- no questions. And asked for clarity on the other bills. Then paid the ones that were clear to me already. And I
offered to help your burn by 1k a month with the HELOC.
What is getting lost in translation? I have said this will happen with lawyers as the go between since last year. Why would we turn over every detail to
hired guns? Come on Christine, please work with me.

So this entire situation has been incredibly frustrating for me, and I want to be direct about why. From the very beginning, even in our first
meetings with Yurushka, my goal has always been to make the smartest financial decisions for both of us and the estate we leave for our kids. I
feel like you knew there was a better way to handle this equalization payment, and I ended up being played. Like this was just another point on
the scoreboard.
You and I could structure this in a way that didn’t send a huge portion of our money to the government in taxes—money that could have been
used for Mac and AD. This is your area of expertise. It’s your career. Throughout our marriage, I contributed by bringing in large numbers,
and you managed those numbers wisely. I always trusted you to act in the best interest of the family, and I feel like that trust wasn’t
reciprocated when it came to dividing things up.
I understand what the mediation document says, but I’m asking—after all the effort I’ve made to keep you in the house, pay off the HELOC,
and ensure stability for everyone if we can reconsider the strategy to achieve the liquidity you need without sending unnecessary money to the
IRS. The kids would benefit far more from those funds being used for their education, therapy, or future security.
I’m not trying to re-litigate but to appeal to values I hope we share: making the best decisions for the kids and preserving what we’ve worked so
hard to build. I hope you’ll consider this and work with me to find a better solution for us all that does not impact you. The inability to even
have this discussion adds to the frustration so I hope we can do better for our long term health. >31

Jan 1 if I sell in 2024 makes it immaterial. Correct?
Then it is simply a semantics game we are playing. The point is to move the tax hit to save the extra 7k.
If you are unwilling to wait for the sale on Jan 1 to clear and get your check, I think the discussion is over.

If you go into Fidelity, you can generate your statement for taxable gain/loss on your stock sales both in msft account and individual account .
 Page 165 of 358

----------------------------------------
That will be your liability for capital gains. We will split the capital loss in jt fidelity account which is about 70k.
In mediation, you had option to transfer some of your 401k to equalize me. Your 401k continues to appreciate and you have benefited from
those gains since oct 31 and I have not, but decided instead to give me cash immediately which our side assumed was factored into your offer
but that was speculation on our part. By doing so  you would bear those capital gains from resulting stock sales to generate the cash. That was
the trade off that we speculated you did. You kept gains in 401k but took hit on capital gains on sale.
I agreed to Jan 1, but that also means you need to have that cash ready that date. I assumed you would need to sell stock prior to that.

You will pay on your unemployment income, deferred comp income, capital gains from the fidelity msft account and losses from jt account.

Today we are in the 35% bracket. I need to sell 200k to pay off everything and move things around. Then, if I sell the 300K, we will push to the
next bracket, and our tax bill will go up. Below is my calculation based on that.

Fidelity. I saw the split of msft account. I looked and there was indeed a deposit of additional msft shares on Dec 2. Let me come back on the

Max medical still outstanding. I’ve sent it multiple times now.
The kids health insurance and your portion has been outstanding since August. I’ll send it again.
You just asked for Sbux insurance numbers. I’m paying full cost of your insurance through my payroll deductions, and you’ve refused to pay me
back.
You decided the inheritance from my parents was yours plus the cash gifts they sent last year which you were spending on face and hair treatments,
funding your fancy dinners and trip to Bali.I’m sure you won’t be sending me anything you receive from your side as inheritance in the future.
I couldn’t ask for spousal as you had refused to work. First it was retired then voluntarily unemployed.
I asked for larger share of assets. You said no.
I asked for larger child support. You said no.
I asked you bear your own spend last year and I bear mine, and you said no. I had to cover your 170k excess for hair treatments, 1k dinners, trip to
Bali.

I saw I got 9836 transferred into my fidelity account. Was it supposed to be 9986, if we split 19972? I think it was less because of your hair
debit card purchase of 299.
I also saw there was a dividend from msft come into the fidelity msft account.
Can you split the dividend of 2892 52% 48%? and transfer to my account so I would receive 1,503.
Thank you!

I’m getting worried because I don’t know how you plan to communicate or plan going into a Friday night again. Kari and Alan, and of course AD
and me don’t know if plans are changing tomorrow or not.
That puts me in an uncomfortable position to try and nudge you given past history and four people could be impacted. I don’t like being the
“nudger.” That is why I asked for two minutes on the phone.

Super frustrating not to be able to get answers to easy q’s. It’s a 30 second call but I wait hours. You know I’m going to respond because I have
milliseconds at best, but you do this anyway.
I finally got us on a call today and overcame weeks of bickering and crossed wires. It got the exact outcome you asked for, most in real time. So I can’t

“nudger.” That is why I asked for two minutes on the phone.
This makes me feel uncomfortable.

Can we sync on AD plans given he feels crummy?
I would rather him start a bit later in the day and still make it than force an early start to make this time here. And go straight into a session. Just
hearing that already sounds draining to me.
But if we shift it might work better and we can all couch camp. It’s and idea because I don’t want a big backlog of makeups which could
otherwise be Thurs, tomorrow, maybe Whistler Sat… ?

Alright.
Alan said that you will communicate with him. Should I tell him my thoughts and have him text them to you?
Then you can reply to him and he can tell me. And we just keep that up until we reach an agreement?
Or alternatively, you and Alan can just cut me out as unnecessary. Save some steps and you two parent.

I asked if I could coordinate with you based on the plans for the Nutcracker. He is sound asleep. If you are going to pass, I would have him just
continue to sleep. If you are going to insist on going anyway, I’d make him sleep take up sooner and send him home. It’s a simple discussion that
would take 30 seconds if you wanted to do this right instead of swapping 20 OFW emails and then forking with Alan through texts that don’t have
the info required to make the determination.
Yesterday was largely the same. Kari asked again if she could do Sunday. I asked to plan so perhaps he started later to salvage the day. You refused to
answer Kari or even acknowledge the question. I asked for a 30 second conversation. You just went dark with four people waiting on you to check in
and when you did you did not have all the facts. Something I could have clarified easily.
I’m sorry that you feel like this is abusive. That reminds me of your accusations at Children’s hospital. I don’t know how to crack the nut with you,
Christine.
If you won’t give me any information to optimize for his health vs. your night’s plans, I’ll make the decision myself. I was just trying to help you both
out.Sent: 12/14/2024 at 03:28 PM

I asked if I could coordinate with you based on the plans for the Nutcracker. He is sound asleep. If you are going to pass, I would have him just
continue to sleep. If you are going to insist on going anyway, I’d make him sleep take up sooner and send him home. It’s a simple discussion
that would take 30 seconds if you wanted to do this right instead of swapping 20 OFW emails and then forking with Alan through texts that
don’t have the info required to make the determination.
Yesterday was largely the same. Kari asked again if she could do Sunday. I asked to plan so perhaps he started later to salvage the day. You
refused to answer Kari or even acknowledge the question. I asked for a 30 second conversation. You just went dark with four people waiting on
you to check in and when you did you did not have all the facts. Something I could have clarified easily.
I’m sorry that you feel like this is abusive. That reminds me of your accusations at Children’s hospital. I don’t know how to crack the nut with
you, Christine.
If you won’t give me any information to optimize for his health vs. your night’s plans, I’ll make the decision myself. I was just trying to help
you both out.

Just like three years sober. That’s a lie
The fact I did not respond in a 15 min timeframe today was no reason to send these messages.
Nutcracker tickets were purchased prior to rescheduling to today. If you plan to weaponize changes in schedule I accommodated against me, that just
sets the stage.

Christine, I have done everything humanly possible to work with you. If you have a suggestion of something I did not do please bring it up with me.
Our history is replete  with me asking to turn the page, do something new together to work on behalf of the kids, at least for their mental health.
I stressed this again on the 10th. But you were busy with girls night as your priority. Then I followed up last week addressing every concern you had.
Now we have 35 response long OFW thread trying to figure out AD’s time instead of a 30 second phone call. He missed Kari and went home early.
“Let me think about it,” that’s all you have said for over a year. My assumption is that it will go for many more years. Nothing changes with you.
I am always nice in front of AD, I don’t scream or wag my finger “we are at war.” That’s not good for him. I want him to love the part of them that is
you.
How would you like to handle tonight? Do we show him that we put him first? That’s what I would propose. You have seen I do that. Your call.Sent: 12/15/2024 at 06:24 PM

We discussed two parts tonight. One was a perquisite to starting the second. Neither are stand-alone events. The goal is simple- be better parents.
The presumption is that with professional help, we can either get the tools we need to be better parents by addressing some of our history or never
saying another word about it. I’m ok with either option.
But if we do this it opens up a whole new world of joint collaboration together. On things that would make a material impact on our kids future. As a
byproduct, we might be happier people too.
I do not want to say what we are agreeing to. I always do that. I want to defer to you. Please let me know what your interpretation is for what we will
do to mend old wounds and be better parents now.

energy to document every single concern you had and even paid you back in realtime rather than argue with you. And then you gave away
tickets that you transferred to me. So now you want $ for tickets that you were able to give away. The contrast in mutual respect and
expectations are beyond astounding.

We split 8 games and this is left over.
If you want them you can pay me for my half - 264
Do you want me to list the tickets and we split the proceeds?
Just LMK.

We discussed two parts tonight. One was a perquisite to starting the second. Neither are stand-alone events. The goal is simple- be better
parents.
The presumption is that with professional help, we can either get the tools we need to be better parents by addressing some of our history or
never saying another word about it. I’m ok with either option.
But if we do this it opens up a whole new world of joint collaboration together. On things that would make a material impact on our kids
future. As a byproduct, we might be happier people too.
I do not want to say what we are agreeing to. I always do that. I want to defer to you. Please let me know what your interpretation is for what

This is abusive Robert.
I asked you to make the FIRST pick for months and months and you refused. I gave you access to the sheet. It is documented. With lawyers
and OFW
After you refused to make any movement I split the tickets rather than have them go to waste after you refused to do anything.
After you refused to accept the tickets after you had them in your e-mail for weeks and weeks and day of said you could not use them. That is
documented.
I will try sell the tickets.

There is less in the account now as you have some personal expenses deducting from it.
If you are still confirming with Lisa if it is 50/50 split versus a 52/48 split, can you transfer 1,446 now then wait for confirmation.

Can you transfer my 52% of the 2,892 msft dividend paid on Dec 12 that remains in the account. 52% is equal to 1,503.
There is less in the account now as you have some personal expenses deducting from it.
If you are still confirming with Lisa if it is 50/50 split versus a 52/48 split, can you transfer 1,446 now then wait for confirmation.
There was also a deposit of 14.959 shares on Dec 2. My share per agreement was to be 52% however fidelity split 50%. Please let me know what
Lisa view on this as this will impact future drops.

You have threads and asks across two platforms and multiple entries. Last Thursday I consolidated everything I could find into one place so we could
keep our running list format.
Now issues are fragmented again, you are missing key details, and you won’t agree to the solution that has worked in the past- the running list
meeting. I don’t get why, but it’s your call.
I want to work with you but I’m not doing it this way. It takes up too much time, energy, and explanation in the back and forth. Please suggest

Happy to resolve our issues, but if it is your prerogative to say that you refuse the organized and structured way that works, it is also mine to push

Our inability to execute even the most mundane tasks even while I say “screw it, I’ll pay you to make it go away” is a testament to why we need the

Then what did we just do with great effectiveness? We just did it last week. Are we saying that we can never communicate? I’m out if so. I’m not
doing this cross platform multi thread, hair on fire confusion. I am making it crystal clear to you that you don’t read what I send, ask for the wrong
things, and confuse the situation even worse. I simply can’t track so I think we may have just screwed ourselves.
The gaslighting is saying you are not secretly involved with Kevin when I have pictures you deny, telling Elsa, Christina, Katherine, Milo when you
said you had not, that you will accept the plan Dr Brown gave us, that you will correct the TRO that your attorney admitted was a mistake, agreeing
to follow Jennifer’s recommendation and then saying your signature means zilch…. I can go on.
If you have a single example that Connor says is DV please send the actual text. That’s all I ask. Not you saying it, give me the verbatim example. And
him saying that example is DV. That’s easy, right?

Just reviewed what you demanded. That is super unfortunate. As I was trying to turn over a new leaf with you based on the ">31" you and Natalie
actually went for a much deeper and more draconian solution. Making it fully impossible to communicate. Unfortunate, given how well OFW only
has worked thus far (not at all). But you two sure showed me for trying to help.
It's weird. I sit with you at at hoops, talk about all the ways I want to help—I have sent so many ways I tried already—and explain that if you just let
me, we can start working together (ex: kid's insurance.) You seemed like you would consider it. We talked about therapy, and you said you would ask
your therapist. But now I see this demand. That is what gaslighting is.

Then what did we just do with great effectiveness? We just did it last week. Are we saying that we can never communicate? I’m out if so. I’m
not doing this cross platform multi thread, hair on fire confusion. I am making it crystal clear to you that you don’t read what I send, ask for
the wrong things, and confuse the situation even worse. I simply can’t track so I think we may have just screwed ourselves.
The gaslighting is saying you are not secretly involved with Kevin when I have pictures you deny, telling Elsa, Christina, Katherine, Milo when
you said you had not, that you will accept the plan Dr Brown gave us, that you will correct the TRO that your attorney admitted was a
mistake, agreeing to follow Jennifer’s recommendation and then saying your signature means zilch…. I can go on.
If you have a single example that Connor says is DV please send the actual text. That’s all I ask. Not you saying it, give me the verbatim
example. And him saying that example is DV. That’s easy, right?
So I assume if this is all we have- there is no “>31”

You have threads and asks across two platforms and multiple entries. Last Thursday I consolidated everything I could find into one place so we
could keep our running list format.
Now issues are fragmented again, you are missing key details, and you won’t agree to the solution that has worked in the past- the running list
meeting. I don’t get why, but it’s your call.
I want to work with you but I’m not doing it this way. It takes up too much time, energy, and explanation in the back and forth. Please suggest
something better than what we know works.
Happy to resolve our issues, but if it is your prerogative to say that you refuse the organized and structured way that works, it is also mine to
push back on something that clearly does not.
Our inability to execute even the most mundane tasks even while I say “screw it, I’ll pay you to make it go away” is a testament to why we need
the help you have refused for over a year now.
I don’t know how many times I have typed up the definition of insanity you used to quote to me, but I know you know it well. I’m asking for
something different. I want “>31” instead.
Please stop the crazy. Let’s work together.

So I think that you are required to inform me about major educational decisions, such as class placement or pursuing advanced placement, via the
Our Family Wizard (OFW) platform.
You should give me at least seven days' notice so that I can provide feedback. After considering my input, then you can then make the final decision
based on your authority.
For something like this in the middle of a toxic divorce where I have watched Adrain flail for months emotionally and academically, I don't expect
that formality, but I'd like to confer.
Two teachers recently said that Max was getting Fs. Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely disqualifies him
for advanced placement in math.
This is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead. Would you mind sharing the
plan to get them on track at home?
I want to partner with you on our messaging and guidance as parents, but I don't want to be overbearing and give them a double whammy. I can also
help AD if he is here visting.
Let me know how we can coordinate. It seems like SAAS is doing its part; it's just when they leave and go home that we have the challenge. Let's make
those Stanford trips worth something.Sent: 12/18/2024 at 12:19 PM

So I think that you are required to inform me about major educational decisions, such as class placement or pursuing advanced placement, via
the Our Family Wizard (OFW) platform.
You should give me at least seven days' notice so that I can provide feedback. After considering my input, then you can then make the final
decision based on your authority.
For something like this in the middle of a toxic divorce where I have watched Adrain flail for months emotionally and academically, I don't
expect that formality, but I'd like to confer.

Two teachers recently said that Max was getting Fs. Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely
disqualifies him for advanced placement in math.
This is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead. Would you mind
sharing the plan to get them on track at home?
I want to partner with you on our messaging and guidance as parents, but I don't want to be overbearing and give them a double whammy. I
can also help AD if he is here visting.
Let me know how we can coordinate. It seems like SAAS is doing its part; it's just when they leave and go home that we have the challenge.
Let's make those Stanford trips worth something.
thanks in advance on the partnership to be the best parents we can for these guys!

Just connected with Alan. He had no idea what you scheduled for Adrian today. Fortunately for AD, another child unfortunately was ill. How
should I work with you on issues related to him moving forward? Does he know he is coming over here like we discussed with Kari?
I think that you own the calendar. If that was incorrect, my bad. I desperately want to work with you (across all the things you are unilaterally
deciding) and keep asking how, but it feels like I can’t crack the nut. Open to any advice that shows mutual respect and understanding.
Were you able to speak with your therapist so we could get the green light to work on tools for you and I, like we discussed at hoops? I really can’t
think of anything that will pay bigger dividends than you and I working together to be better parents. Starting the new year right.Sent: 12/19/2024 at 02:50 PM

should I work with you on issues related to him moving forward? Does he know he is coming over here like we discussed with Kari?
I think that you own the calendar. If that was incorrect, my bad. I desperately want to work with you (across all the things you are unilaterally
deciding) and keep asking how, but it feels like I can’t crack the nut. Open to any advice that shows mutual respect and understanding.
Were you able to speak with your therapist so we could get the green light to work on tools for you and I, like we discussed at hoops? I really
can’t think of anything that will pay bigger dividends than you and I working together to be better parents. Starting the new year right.

You didn’t really answer the question. Especially, if you envision a place for me in his life for academic discussions. I did get him into SAAS so
maybe that’s all you wanted after he got rejected. So let me know.

accommodate the way we addressed every issue you had at this exact time last week? Instead, you got all your answers and then said “I’m not

Adrian is never picked up at school. I pay $125 an hour. I’d prefer to pay that for the time I spend with him.
And given the pressing topic, and one that you refuse to reply to for some reason- can you speak to the math situation and get back to me on
that! I see him in less than two hours. It is always this way with you.

So I think that you are required to inform me about major educational decisions, such as class placement or pursuing advanced placement, via
the Our Family Wizard (OFW) platform.
You should give me at least seven days' notice so that I can provide feedback. After considering my input, then you can then make the final
decision based on your authority.
For something like this in the middle of a toxic divorce where I have watched Adrain flail for months emotionally and academically, I don't
expect that formality, but I'd like to confer.
Two teachers recently said that Max was getting Fs. Yesterday, we heard AD was not turning in work, and today, we hear that it likely
disqualifies him for advanced placement in math.
This is not stuff that happens during school hours. In both cases, it reflects their extracurricular and home life instead. Would you mind
sharing the plan to get them on track at home?
I want to partner with you on our messaging and guidance as parents, but I don't want to be overbearing and give them a double whammy. I
can also help AD if he is here visting.
Let me know how we can coordinate. It seems like SAAS is doing its part; it's just when they leave and go home that we have the challenge.

I think we had sent questions to Natalie about you making all the changes that you said I made to our accounts. You were actually kind enough
to send the dashboard that showed you were not telling the truth. That made it super simple to sus you out.
As noted, you secretly initiated email changes to both of my email accounts and I immediately noticed that changes had been made that were
screen captured. If we should revisit what you did, I’ll be happy to ask Lisa to get your answers  from Natalie.
Neither account has behaved the same since and I had hoped it was juts an innocent mistake. This seems like more nefarious activity that we
should perhaps pursue through legal channels before Carolyn starts. Let me know. I have the digital accounting.
Of course digital proof has never mattered Tumblecreek.

Since this is three days in a row, I honestly don't think I can afford it at $3k. These are killing me.
I'd like Thursday, skip Friday and bank it for the 45-day hold in the PP, and have Sat as planned.

Thanks for the reply! I will let him know.
Just something to consider: It might be better if we have the same arrangement we do for Kari and communicate together via email. I think it is
basically the same thing.

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.

So....
I am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it up, and I
think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.
I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a sleepover.
This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?
Merry Christmas to the Moyer's. So weird not to be in the family that bears my name.

Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.
Thank you.

I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?

Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as

I am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it
up, and I think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.
I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?
Merry Christmas to the Moyer's. So weird not to be in the family that bears my name.

Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as
we planned!  Really think they should enjoy their gifts this year!
Hope you are having an awesome time!

So....
I am hoping that since I did all of our Santa gifts last year and we never said anything different, I can piggyback off you this year. I brought it
up, and I think you said you would get back to me, but I have not seen anything.
I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?
Merry Christmas to the Moyer's. So weird not to be in the family that bears my name.

Just wanted to let you know we did good.
Some awesome stocking stuffers from Mom & Dad. A really cool robotics set (1 each) from Mom & Dad. And then their big gift from Santa as
we planned!  Really think they should enjoy their gifts this year!
Hope you are having an awesome time!

So I put $500 in this AM because it looked overdrawn. I’ll try to see whats up but any forensic records you have would be helpful. I would swear I got
it right but but maybe not. If you share your fidelity and BofA account numbers I can set those up.. but now that I say that I think I have the BofA
already because I transfer the 2.1k …. I’m a little lost. I’ll work on thisSent: 12/26/2024 at 01:33 PM

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.
Thank you.

I see 500 go in, your cell phone deduct, then transfer out of 1,504.

So I sent the email confirmations from the origin intuitions earlier trying to show what I had done. Then this landed. Going back and forth across
platforms is very hard and will always be fraught with delays and mistakes. And we can't move Fidelity or BofA to OFW.
I will rarely get this right across platforms, accounts, credits, debits,, etc.. I am just letting you know in the most constructive way possible, that this is
super frustrating, hard to track and will always increase unnecessary friction between you and I till Adrian is 18 years old.Sent: 12/26/2024 at 02:09 PM

Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.

So I have raised an issue with the effectiveness of our communications since we can’t keep Fidelity, BofA, various school, therapy, or compliance folks
always on the thread for personal stuff. You did not respond.
 Should I assume that moving forward we just go through lawyers from now on? My hope from the discussion on the 19th was we would begin to
work together a little more cooperatively. Let me know.Sent: 12/27/2024 at 07:10 PM

I don't see Max or Elsa at all, and I have not had time to discuss this with AD. Last year, we made our own ornaments, decorated, and had a
sleepover. This year, there is nothing—not even a tree. I just don't exist anymore.
I hope you and I work together better in the new year.  Can you please let me know?

Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.

I see 500 go in, your cell phone deduct, then transfer out of 1,504.
SafeCo will have an automatic deduction of 756.50 early January - I transferred my potion in already, so there needs to have that balance as a

Last Thursday he said he was not sure to me and Alan. I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said you

Also not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was kinda

A dividend for msft stock was posted to the Fidelity account on Dec 22 in amount of 2,892.
Per agreement, my 52% portion (equal 1,504) should be transferred within 10 days. Could you send that over?
If you are still in disagreement if 50 versus 52%, at minimum you can transfer the 50% of 1,446 until you confirm with Lisa.
Thank you.

Christine,
I agree that professional guidance on addressing these situations is valuable. But I also note that your response feels threatening and almost like
retaliation for raising several specific concerns about Adrian's well-being and our co-parenting communication. I asked you about:
- Today's 40-minute delay which impacts my limited time with Adrian and has significant financial implications at $1k a day.
- The portrayal to Adrian that I "won't reply" about visits misrepresents my efforts and damages my relationship with him.
- Emergency communication protocols are a standard safety consideration, and you allow for no way to accommodate them.
- The concerning shift in Adrian's view of MIT from pride to mockery between visits suggests harmful negative influences on him.Sent: 12/28/2024 at 10:48 AM

Last Thursday he said he was not sure to me and Alan. I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said

Also not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was
kinda teasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.
Maybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind of

Christine,
I agree that professional guidance on addressing these situations is valuable. But I also note that your response feels threatening and almost like
retaliation for raising several specific concerns about Adrian's well-being and our co-parenting communication. I asked you about:
- Today's 40-minute delay which impacts my limited time with Adrian and has significant financial implications at $1k a day.
- The portrayal to Adrian that I "won't reply" about visits misrepresents my efforts and damages my relationship with him.
- Emergency communication protocols are a standard safety consideration, and you allow for no way to accommodate them.
- The concerning shift in Adrian's view of MIT from pride to mockery between visits suggests harmful negative influences on him.
Please maintain our message thread rather than forking and creating new ones. Forking threads can misrepresent the context and chronology of
our communication, which has happened a lot since this began. I don't think that is helpful to either of us when seeking helpful advice.
Looking forward to understanding a healthier way to address the points above, as they were not addressed in a constructive way.

For that matter, if they are in a car wreck getting here, what is your and Natalie’s plan for us to communicate and figure that out? Is it just wait
till we both know they are missing AND you check OFW? Curious.

Does he know he’s coming over?
Last Thursday he said he was not sure to me and Alan. I said it was “a regular day so count on it”. To which he replied “I know but Mom said
you won’t reply so we don’t know “  Let’s work on that. It’s not really fair to couch me that way.
Also not sure where he got the idea that MIT was like Phoenix university but that happened between his visits. He started proud and then was
kinda teasing me next time. Admission was super tough and the classes are really hard.
Maybe these things are beyond your control but bringing it up so you know I don’t think it’s good for him to look at me like some kind of
clown. I know you replaced me on July 4th, but he can’t so let’s make the best of it for him.

Please share with your therapist and Cimberleigh and perhaps they can provide feedback directly.
I dont feel comfortable doing that directly with you.
In discussions with her she had not received Connor’s report yet per pp. Has Luis?

Not sure why there was a 40 min delay.
Adrian was aware of today’s visit.
You stated you would refrain from making jabs at me. They have continued.

I’m done with your aggression.
You have been in violation of the requirements for sober link in the parenting plan which means visitations stop until court order.
Holiday schedule is also dictated by the parenting plan.
